/// \file undef_macros.hpp
/// \brief Undefines every POET macro to prevent namespace pollution.
///
/// The umbrella header `<poet/poet.hpp>` includes this as its last include, so
/// macros are cleaned up by default.  If you include individual POET headers
/// instead, include this one after all code that uses POET macros.
///
/// Re-including `<poet/core/macros.hpp>` afterwards restores them.
///
/// Only macros are removed: `poet::detail::count_trailing_zeros` and the
/// template utilities (static_for, dynamic_for, dispatch) stay available.
///
/// Deliberately has no include guard: the macros.hpp/undef_macros.hpp cycle must
/// be repeatable, and a guard here would silently make every pass after the
/// first a no-op. `#undef` is idempotent, so re-including costs nothing.

// Re-arm macros.hpp so a subsequent include redefines everything.
// (`#undef` of an undefined macro is a well-formed no-op, so nothing is guarded.)
